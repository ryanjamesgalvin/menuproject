***Introduction***

This is a python script that uses Flask and SQLAlchemy to generate a website of a list of 
fictional restaurants and restaurant menus, complete with create, read, update and delete
functionality.

***Running***

Download or clone the repository onto your computer by running

`git clone https://github.com/ryanjamesgalvin/menuproject`

in your terminal. Assuming an installation of Python 3.6, if you do not have Flask and SQLAlchemy
installed, run 

`pip install sqlalchemy`

and

`pip install flask`

to install these dependencies. Then run the python script menupage.py either through python's IDLE,
or type

`python menupage.py` in your terminal. Navigate to localhost:5000 in your browser to see the app.
